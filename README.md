# Python-Web-Portfolio-Series-1

Welcome to Comedy Central!
We made this website to create fun website where you can learn about all things comedy. We have everything from knock knock jokes, programming jokes, the joke of the day, funny movie recomendations and the history of comedy!

How To Run:
Press Run and open in a new tab. You will be directed to the Home page, which will have welcome message next week. Use the menu to be redirected to other pages(no information on each page, however, they are functional). If you add /playground into the URL, you can find the secret joke. We used this page to test our code and also as a fun reward for those who found the page.

Purpose of The Project
This project was created to learn about HTML language and some CSS. In this project, both Python and HTML are used

File Descriptions
main.py: is in python, imports the html files. Has routes for each page and URL.

base.html: base for webstite, the back end which connects all the components

comediandecades.html: has information about some iconic comedians throught the ages

historyofcomdedy.html: has fun facts about the history of comedy

home.html: our home page, the first thing you see when you click the link to the website

knock.html: our page full of knock knock jokes and a small preview of the hilarous jokes to come

playground.html: a page we use to test code if we need to preview something before putting it on a main page
